# Developer Diary

## Day 0

I set up my repository for the game jam, copy my core libraries and the basic `main.lua` and `conf.lua` files, ant test that everything runs without issues.

I have been thinking about what type of game I want to do in this short period of time. With the theme in place, I wanted to come up with some ideas, and I started writing down what it came to my mind when thinking about `connection`:

- Physical connection
  - Connecting cables
  - Connecting energy
    - Radio waves
    - Internet / Computers
    - Electricity
  - Connect points
  - Connect cities
    - Transport
  - Connect worlds
  - Connect chains
- Spiritual connection
  - Connect with nature
  - Connect with people
  - Connect with someone
  - Connect ideas
    - Detective game

Out of these, the one that first I wanted to do was some kind of `Tentacle Wars` kind of game, where you have a mainframe computer and want to hack the enemy mainframe, and there are some computers in between you have to hack. The enemy does not stay still, and he can do the same thing, hacking other computers to destroy you.

This first idea was discarded because of the complexity of building the enemy AI, which I haven't done yet, and seems to complex to do at my current level.

Then came the next idea. You are a knight of some sort that needs to protect a princess that is casting a magic spell to destroy all the undeads of the kingdom. The princess needs time to cast the spell, so you need to go around killing the zombies. You kill them by simply clicking them. When you kill them, you earn points. However, you can chain kills by draging the mouse from enemy to enemy, obtaining more points the bigger the chain. The enemies do not focus you, they go towards the princess from random directions of the screen. The princess has some magic shield that can withstand some amount of damage made from the zombies. When all zombies are dead, you can use your points earned and buy upgrades for the knight (move speed, attack speed, attack damage) or the princess (increase max shield, recover shield).

I think this should be a good starting point, and looks easy to prototype during the first weekend.

I will try to come up with a rough plan of what the game should look like (user story), and the steps to achieve it. I will be using `Masterplan` to keep track of what I need to do, as it is easier to manage than `Jira`.

The user story is written under [User Story](./UserStory.md) and the plan is set. Now all is left is to wait until the game jam begins to start coding!

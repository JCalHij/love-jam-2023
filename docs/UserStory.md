There is a zombie outbreak and a knight that needs to protect a princess until she casts a magic spell that destroys all zombies. The player moves the knight around with their mouse by specifying which zombie to attack. The player can select a single zombie to attack by clicking on one, or select multiple and perform a chain by dragging the mouse over multiple zombies. When the mouse is released, the knight will automatically move to intercept those zombies and attack them before they reach the princess. In the case where the zombies do reach the princess, she has a magic shield protecting her from some harm. When the protection is lost, all enemies are knocked back a certain distance and then try to attack the princess. The moment the princess is directly attacked the player loses the game.

Enemies come in waves, and multiple enemies can appear. There are the normal zombies, fast zombies, fat zombies and aberrations. Each one of them has a different amount of hit points, move speed and attack damage. The player has attack speed, attack damage and move speed as stats, which they can improve between waves using the points earned by killing zombies. The player can also replenish the magic shields of the princess, as well as making more (recovering and increasing max HP of the princess' shield) with their points.

The game finishes when a certain amount of waves have passed or when the princess gets killed.

Graphics are pretty simple, pixel-art. There are sounds for player attacking, enemies spawning and some background music.

The game provides a simple title screen, where the player can only go to the main game. Credits are written at the bottom of the screen.
